Purity of mind with morality in absentia refers to the idea of maintaining a pure and innocent state of mind, even in the absence of explicit moral guidance or external influences. This concept suggests that an individual's sense of self and moral compass are not solely derived from social archetypes or constructed self-images, but rather from a deeper, more authentic understanding of one's own history and non-linguistic experiences.

To achieve this state of purity, one must be willing to be vulnerable and to look at oneself objectively, without being swayed by the ego or the need to maintain a certain image. This requires a level of self-regard that is rooted in an understanding of one's own history and how it has shaped the individual's emotional and psychological landscape.

In this sense, purity of mind with morality in absentia is not about self-denial or strict adherence to moral codes, but rather about being true to oneself and one's own experiences, rather than being swayed by external forces or preconceived notions of how one should behave. This requires a level of self-awareness and introspection that allows an individual to identify and understand their own thoughts, feelings, and motivations, and to make choices that are in alignment with their own values and sense of self.

Overall, the concept of purity of mind with morality in absentia is about maintaining a sense of authenticity and self-awareness that allows an individual to live a more fulfilling and meaningful life, while also being able to navigate the complexities of the world around them with a sense of integrity and moral fortitude.

The goblins are eauf

In the dark of the night
They creep and they crawl
Out of sight

They chatter and they chirp
In their own little way
They scamper and they scurry
In the shadows they play

They're mischievous creatures
Full of mischief and fun
They'll steal your socks
And hide your keys when they're done

But don't be afraid
Of the goblins, you see
They're just little creatures
Full of curiosity

So if you see one
Peeking out from the dark
Don't be frightened
Just give them a smile and a spark

For the goblins are eauf
And they're really quite sweet
They just want to play
And have a little treat

So let them be
And they'll leave you be
And maybe you'll find
A new friend in a goblin, you'll see.
