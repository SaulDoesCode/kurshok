This script is a custom DOM attribute system that allows the user to register a custom attribute, which will be initialized and listened to for changes and removals through a mutation observer.

The mutation observer is used to listen for changes and removals of registered attributes, and also detects new attributes dynamically added to elements after the page has loaded.

Philosopher 1: Madness is the only true form of enlightenment!

Philosopher 2: But how can that be? Reason and logic are the foundations of philosophy!

Philosopher 1: Ha! Reason and logic are mere constructs of the limited human mind. Madness allows us to break free from those constraints and truly understand the universe.

Philosopher 2: But without reason and logic, how can we even have a coherent conversation?

Philosopher 1: Coherence is overrated. The beauty of madness is that it allows us to embrace the chaos and embrace the unknown.

Philosopher 2: I suppose that is one way to look at it. But surely there must be some limits to this madness.

Philosopher 1: Limits? There are no limits! Madness knows no boundaries. It is the ultimate liberation from the shackles of the human condition.

Philosopher 2: I must admit, you have a compelling argument. Perhaps I too must embrace madness to truly understand the universe.

Philosopher 1: That's the spirit! Only through madness can we hope to unlock the secrets of the universe.

Philosopher 2: Yes, let us embrace madness together and unlock the mysteries of the universe.




Guy had just gotten out of work when he saw her. She was lying on the side of the road, barely breathing. He didn't hesitate to help her, picking her up and carrying her to his car.

As he drove her to the hospital, she began to stir, her eyes fluttering open. She looked at him with a mix of confusion and gratitude.

"Thank you," she whispered.

Guy nodded, not wanting to disturb her any further. He couldn't help but feel drawn to her, even though he had no idea who she was.

But his fiancé didn't see it that way. When he told her about the girl, she broke up with him on the spot, saying he was being selfish and irresponsible.

Heartbroken, Guy decided to take the girl to a strange person he had heard about from a friend. This person was rumored to have the ability to heal any injury or illness.

As they arrived at the person's secluded cabin in the woods, the girl's condition seemed to improve. She was able to sit up and speak more clearly.

But when they entered the cabin, the girl disappeared with the person. Guy frantically searched for her, but she was nowhere to be found.

Desperate, he turned to the person for answers. The person revealed that the girl was actually an alien, and they had taken her back to her own planet to heal her properly.

Guy was stunned, but also relieved that the girl was safe. However, the person also revealed that Guy had been exposed to alien technology during the rescue, and as a result, he had become invisible to normies - human beings without alien abilities.

At first, Guy struggled to adapt to his new invisible state. But eventually, he found a community of other invisible people like himself, and he learned to embrace his new identity.

And even though he never saw the girl again, he never forgot about her, and the strange events that led him to become invisible.




Truth is a shining light,

Guiding us through the darkest night.

It shines with a steady glow,

Never faltering, never slow.

It is the beacon that leads us on,

Through the storms and battles we must face.

It is the beacon that shines within,

Guiding us to our rightful place.

With truth as our guide,

We need not fear the unknown.

For even in the darkest hour,

We will never be alone.

For truth will light the way,

And guide us to the end.

Through all the trials and tribulations,

We will find strength and peace within.

So let us hold on to truth,

And let it guide us on our way.

For with truth by our side,

We will never lose our way.


In the stillness of the night
When all is quiet, and all is right
The soul takes flight
To a place of peace and light

Where worries and fears
Are cast aside and disappear
In this place of serenity
The soul is free

To roam and explore
To love and to soar
To find its true home
Where it is never alone

For in this place
The soul finds grace
And is filled with love
Sent from the heavens above

Here it is free to be
All that it was meant to be
In this place, the soul resides
Forever, it abides.


# Where the soul resides

Oh soul, where do you reside
In the stillness of the night
When all is quiet and all is right
Do you take flight

To a place of peace and light
Where worries and fears
Are cast aside and disappear
Is this a place of serenity
Where you are free

To roam and explore
To love and to soar
To find your true home
Where you are never alone

For in this place
Do you find grace
And are you filled with love
Sent from the heavens above

Are you free to be
All that you were meant to be
In this place, do you reside
Forever, do you abide

Or do you roam the earth
In all of its beauty and worth
A part of the world and all it contains
A spirit that forever sustains

Tell me, oh soul, where do you dwell
In this world, or some far-off dell
Wherever it may be
I hope that you are free.



# gravy

In the dead of the night
I'm chillin' with my squad
We're sippin' on some ice cold brews
And makin' moves like we're stars

We hit the club and hit the floor
Dancin' like we don't give a toss
Livin' life like it's ours to own
We're the kings, we're the boss

So if you see us comin' through
You better step aside
Cause we're unfuckwithable, and here to slay
We're the ones you can't deny

We're young and we're fly
We're slick and we're smooth
We're makin' waves and breakin' rules
We're the ones you should pursue

So come along and join the ride
We'll take you to a place you've never known
Where the beats are bumpin' and the vibes are right
We're boppin' groovy, always on the go.


In the world of compromise,
Where we try to be amicable,
We may sometimes find ourselves
In the midst of disagreement,
Unable to see eye to eye.

It's not always easy
To put aside our differences,
And find a way to coexist
In peace and harmony.

But though it may be unpleasant,
To have to disagree with those we care for,
It's sometimes necessary
To stand up for what we believe,
And to defend our own truths.

So let us strive for amicability,
But let us not forget
That sometimes, in order to be true to ourselves,
We must be willing to disagree.


I wish to be amicable,
To engage in civil discourse,
But alas, our opinions clash,
And I find myself at a loss.

I try to be understanding,
To listen and to empathize,
But the more we talk, the more we disagree,
And I find myself feeling paralyzed.

I long for harmony,
To resolve our conflict and move on,
But our perspectives are too different,
And I feel my patience beginning to wane.

I strive to be gracious,
To avoid a heated exchange,
But the more we argue, the more I feel
The need to defend my own stance.

I wish for agreement,
For a peaceful resolution,
But it seems our differences are too great,
And I find myself at a loss.

I will continue to try,
To be amicable and kind,
But I fear our disagreements
May forever sheer us apart.


Dear friend,

I wish to be amicable,
To always be in agreement,
But alas, sometimes we must differ,
And our views must be set aside.

It pains me to disagree with you,
To see our friendship strained,
But I cannot help but speak my truth,
And hope that you'll understand.

Our differences may divide us,
But I pray that we can weather the storm,
For our friendship is worth preserving,
Even when we cannot agree.

So let us be civil,
And respect each other's views,
For though we may not see eye to eye,
Our bond is still worth pursuing.



A poem on the unpleasantries of wanting to be amicable but having uncircumventable dissagreements, written in the second person with a very flowery way


You, my dear, have been hurt
By the harsh words and actions of another
Your delicate heart, once so pure and true
Now bears the wounds of betrayal and abuse

But do not despair, for time will heal
And with each passing day, the pain will fade
Your strength will grow, and you will rise again
Like a phoenix from the ashes, reborn anew

Though the scars may never fully disappear
They will serve as a reminder of your resilience
And the beauty that still lies within you
Shining brighter than ever before

So hold your head high and carry on
For better days are surely on their way
And you, my dear, will emerge victorious
Stronger, wiser, and more beautiful than before.

You, oh sweet soul, who has been wounded
By the sharp words of another
Let the soft petals of forgiveness
Heal your tender heart.

Allow the soothing breeze of compassion
To caress your bruised spirit
And let the gentle rain of understanding
Wash away the hurt.

For in the garden of life
There are always thorns and roses
And it is up to you, dear one,
To nurture the beauty within.

So let go of the pain
And embrace the healing light
For in time, your heart will blossom
And bloom once more.


You feel it deep within, a piercing ache
That cuts through your soul and leaves you in pain

It's like a fire that consumes you whole
Leaving you helpless, with no place to go

You try to escape, to run away
But the hurt follows you, like a shadow that stays

You long for relief, for a soothing touch
But it seems impossible, like trying to grasp the wind

You cry out in desperation, tears streaming down your face
Hoping for a miracle, for a break from this place

But still the pain persists, like a heavy weight
Dragging you down, making it hard to concentrate

You wonder if it will ever end
If you'll ever find the light again

But hold on dear one, don't give up the fight
For though it may be dark now, the dawn will come in sight

And when the sun rises, the pain will fade away
Leaving you stronger, a flower that blooms with grace.


You, dear reader, are a being of delicate intricacies
A vessel of beauty, but also of pain and quirks
Your body aches, protesting against the weight of the world
But still, you persevere, a flower in the midst of a storm

Your joints creak and moan, the result of years of wear and tear
Your muscles tense and spasm, a never-ending battle against discomfort
But still, you rise each day, determined to face the day ahead

Your heart beats fiercely, a constant reminder of life's fragility
Your breath flows in and out, a reminder of the gift of existence
But still, you find moments of joy, of love, of laughter

You are a marvel, dear reader, a marvel of the human condition
A being of strength and resilience, despite the constant pain
You are a flower, blooming in the midst of adversity
A reminder that beauty can be found even in the darkest of places.


sarcasm and a hint of anger:

Dear fallen fool,
You who once held such divine power,
Now reduced to a mere shadow of your former self,
Cast down from the heavens,
A mockery of your former glory.

How the mighty have fallen,
Like a wilting flower in the midst of summer,
Drained of all vitality and vitality,
A pitiable sight to behold.

What happened, oh fallen one?
Did you grow too proud, too full of yourself?
Did you forget the humble beginnings of your creation,
And the fragility of your existence?

Or perhaps it was the allure of temptation,
The alluring whispers of the serpent,
That led you astray from the path of righteousness,
And into the abyss of your own downfall.

No matter the cause,
The outcome remains the same,
A fallen fool,
A laughingstock to all of creation.

But perhaps there is still hope,
A glimmer of redemption,
If you truly repent and turn from your ways,
Maybe, just maybe, you can rise again.

Until then, dear fallen fool,
You will remain a mere shadow of your former self,
A reminder to all of the dangers of pride and temptation,
And the fragility of even the most powerful beings.


# On the abuses of the concept of respect

It is not uncommon for people to use the concept of respect as a way to assert their power over others, particularly when it comes to issues of age and seniority. This can be seen in many different contexts, from the workplace to interpersonal relationships.

One common way that older individuals may abuse the concept of respect is by insisting on being treated deferentially because of their age, even when their ideas or actions are not deserving of such treatment. This can create a power dynamic in which younger individuals feel pressure to conform to the expectations of their elders, even if those expectations are arbitrary or unfair.

Another way that respect can be abused is by using it as a means of silencing dissenting voices or alternative perspectives. For example, an older individual may claim that they deserve respect simply because of their age, and then use that respect as a shield to protect their ideas from criticism or scrutiny. This can stifle important debates and prevent the free exchange of ideas.

In order to address these abuses of the concept of respect, it is important for individuals to be aware of the power dynamics at play and to challenge them when necessary. This may mean standing up to older individuals who attempt to use their age as a justification for demanding respect, or it may mean pushing back against the idea that respect should be automatic or unearned.

Ultimately, respect should be based on the content of an individual's character and actions, rather than their age or social status. By recognizing and challenging the ways in which the concept of respect can be abused, we can create a more equitable and fair society.




Dear soul,

Though you may no longer walk this earth,
Your spirit lives on, forever bound
To the realm of the dead, where you now reside
In the eternal beauty of the underworld.

Your memory lives on, in the hearts of those
Who knew you in life, and loved you still
In the moments of your passing, they shed tears
But now they hold on to the joy you brought

Though you may no longer be seen
Your presence is felt, in the whisper of the wind
In the rustling of leaves, in the chirping of birds
Your essence lives on, in the world of the living.

Rest easy, dear soul, in the arms of the gods
May your journey be filled with light and peace
As you continue on, to the realm beyond.

Journey of Souls, written by Michael Newton, is a controversial and thought-provoking book that delves into the topic of the afterlife and the concept of reincarnation. In the book, Newton presents the results of his research on the experiences of subjects who were hypnotized and taken back to their past lives.

One of the most intriguing aspects of Journey of Souls is the detailed descriptions of the subjects’ past lives. Newton presents a wide variety of different experiences, including lives as royalty, peasants, soldiers, and even animals. The accounts are incredibly vivid and often provide insight into the lives and experiences of individuals from different time periods and cultures.

However, some readers may question the validity of these accounts. The use of hypnosis to uncover past lives has been criticized as a method that is susceptible to false memories and other forms of bias. Furthermore, the accounts are not verifiable, which makes it difficult to determine whether they are accurate or not.

Despite these criticisms, Journey of Souls provides an engaging and thought-provoking exploration of the afterlife and reincarnation. The detailed accounts of the subjects’ past lives are fascinating and provide a unique perspective on these topics. While the validity of the accounts may be questionable, they still offer valuable insights into the nature of the human soul and the afterlife.

Overall, Journey of Souls is a compelling and thought-provoking book that offers a unique perspective on the afterlife and reincarnation. While its methods may be open to criticism, it still provides valuable insights into the nature of the human soul and the mysteries of the afterlife.

Here is an example of a token-based interpreter in Rust that builds text from integers and implements basic programming features by having some tokens have handlers that affect previous or next tokens in a tree-style structure. The interpreter also supports variables and functions.

The interpreter uses a token-based approach, where each token is represented by an enum and handled by a specific method. The interpreter also uses a tree-like structure to evaluate the tokens in the correct order, taking into account the hierarchy of the tokens and their relationship to each other. The interpreter also supports variables and functions, allowing for more complex and dynamic code to be evaluated. Overall, this interpreter provides a basic but flexible framework for evaluating simple programs written in a custom language.

use std::collections::HashMap;

// Define a token enum that represents the different types of tokens the interpreter can handle.
enum Token {
    Integer(i32),
    Plus,
    Minus,
    Lparen,
    Rparen,
    Ident(String),
    Assign,
    FuncDef,
    FuncCall,
    Comma,
    Return,
}

// Define a struct that represents a node in the token tree.
struct Node {
    token: Token,
    // The `children` field is a Vec of nodes that represent the child nodes of the current node.
    children: Vec<Node>,
}

// Define a struct that represents a function in the interpreter.
struct Function {
    // The `arg_names` field is a Vec of strings that represents the names of the arguments that the
    // function takes.
    arg_names: Vec<String>,
    // The `body` field is a Vec of nodes that represents the body of the function.
    body: Vec<Node>,
}

// Define the main interpreter struct.
struct Interpreter {
    // The `vars` field is a HashMap that maps variable names to their values.
    vars: HashMap<String, i32>,
    // The `funcs` field is a HashMap that maps function names to their Function structs.
    funcs: HashMap<String, Function>,
}

// Implement methods on the Interpreter struct.
impl Interpreter {
    // Define a method that evaluates a node and returns its result.
