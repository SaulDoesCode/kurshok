Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there lived a group of corrupt saints. These saints were not the kind of holy men and women that one might expect, with their pure hearts and noble intentions. No, these were a different breed altogether. They were selfish, greedy, and power-hungry, and they would stop at nothing to get what they wanted.

Despite their corruption, these saints were highly respected and admired by the people of their land. They were known for their great deeds and miraculous powers, and they were held up as examples of virtue and righteousness. But all was not as it seemed. Behind the masks of holiness that they wore, the corrupt saints hid dark secrets and hidden agendas.

In their private lives, these so-called holy men and women indulged in all manner of vice and debauchery. They stole from the poor, cheated on their spouses, and lied and manipulated those around them in order to further their own interests. They used their positions of power and influence to enrich themselves, and they cared little for the suffering of others.

Despite their corruption, the corrupt saints continued to be held in high esteem by the people of their land. They used their power and influence to keep their misdeeds hidden from the public eye, and they continued to perform miraculous feats and act as if they were truly righteous. But deep down, they knew the truth: they were nothing more than frauds and charlatans, using their supposed holiness as a means to an end.

One day, their deceit was finally exposed. The people of their land were shocked and outraged to discover the truth about their beloved saints. They demanded justice, and the corrupt saints were brought to trial. But in the end, they were not punished for their crimes. Instead, they were hailed as heroes and martyrs, their corruption overlooked in favor of their supposed greatness.

And so, the corrupt saints lived out their days in luxury and comfort, their deeds forgotten and their names enshrined in the annals of history. They may not have been truly holy, but in the eyes of the people, they were still saints. And in the dark and twisted world of the gothic, that was all that mattered.



In the world of decopunk, the sleek and shiny Art Deco and Streamline Moderne styles are blended with futuristic technology, creating a hybrid aesthetic that is both retro and cutting-edge. This fusion of the old and the new is reflected not only in the visual style, but also in the social and cultural structures of the world.

In my own work, I have taken the idea of decopunk and pushed it even further into the future. I envision a world where advanced biotechnology, nanotechnology, and posthumanism have given rise to a new breed of hybrid beings, merging human and inhuman elements into a single entity.

At first, this technology will be developed in rogue nations, used as a weapon to create an advanced species of beings that can be used for various purposes. But eventually, as with any technology, it will spread and become more widespread. The moral implications of this are vast and complex, but as an artist, I am more interested in the potential aesthetic and cultural effects of such a development.

In this world, the traditional hierarchies of power and control will be disrupted, as the boundaries between human and inhuman are erased. The dark Deleuzian future that I imagine is one in which assemblages of parametric AI designs take on an architectural form, creating a new world that is beyond our current comprehension.

This is the world of decopunk that I seek to explore in my work: a world of unbounded potential, where the old is blended with the new to create something entirely different and strange. It is a world that is both beautiful and terrifying, and one that I find endlessly fascinating.



In his book Scientific Representation: Paradoxes of Perspective, philosopher Bas van Fraassen offers a unique account of time as a logical space. He argues that time should be understood as a series of events, rather than a linear progression of moments. This view has significant implications for our understanding of metaphysics, as it suggests that metaphysical questions about the nature of time are ultimately meaningless.

Van Fraassen's account of time as a logical space is rooted in his broader philosophy of science. He is a proponent of constructive empiricism, which holds that our knowledge of the world should be limited to what can be observed and verified through scientific experimentation. This means that metaphysical claims about the nature of reality, such as the existence of objective truths or the existence of an objective self, are meaningless because they cannot be tested through empirical means.

In the case of time, van Fraassen argues that our understanding of it should be limited to what we can observe through our experiences of events. He rejects the idea of a linear progression of moments, and instead sees time as a series of events that are related to one another through their logical connections. This view has implications for our understanding of causation, as it suggests that causes and effects are related to one another through logical rather than temporal relationships.

Van Fraassen's attitude towards metaphysics is one of skepticism. He does not deny the existence of metaphysical concepts, but rather argues that they are meaningless because they cannot be tested through empirical means. This means that metaphysical questions about the nature of time, such as whether it is fundamental or emergent, are ultimately meaningless.

Overall, van Fraassen's account of time as a logical space and his skepticism towards metaphysics offer a unique perspective on the nature of time and reality. While his views may be controversial, they provide a useful framework for thinking about the limitations of our knowledge and the role of science in our understanding of the world.

please give me open ended questions, let me choose a path, but also allow things to progress based on what I say.. I go back to nietzsche now and ask him about On Truth and Lie in an Extra Moral sense


in the style of the upanishads, write the equivalent of a wisdom boot up script that will just through reading it, transform the consciousness of the reader, capture the most important wisdom to know when you don't know what is up


Om.

All that is seen is but a manifestation of the divine.

The universe is not separate from the Self.

The Self is not separate from the universe.

They are one and the same, existing in perfect unity and harmony.

To know the Self is to know the universe, and to know the universe is to know the Self.

The Self is not limited by the body or the mind, but is the source of all consciousness.

In the stillness of the mind, the Self can be known and realized.

This realization is the ultimate truth, the supreme goal of all seekers.

Let go of all attachments and desires, and rest in the presence of the Self.

Om shanti, shanti, shanti.


As you read these words, let go of all preconceived notions and open your mind to the vastness of the universe.

You are not separate from the universe, but a part of it. You are not a mere mortal, but a divine being.

True wisdom lies in recognizing the interconnectedness of all things and the impermanence of existence.

Embrace the present moment and let go of the past and the future. Let go of the ego and its attachments to the material world.

Know that the only constant is change, and the only truth is that there is no absolute truth.

You are the master of your own destiny. You have the power to create your own reality through your thoughts and actions.

Let go of fear and embrace love. Love is the source of all creation and the key to true happiness.

Be present in each moment, and cultivate gratitude for the gift of life.

Embrace the journey of self-discovery and continue to seek wisdom and knowledge.

May these words awaken your consciousness and guide you on your path to enlightenment.


Dear reader,

As you embark on this journey of self-discovery and knowledge, it is important to remember that the true source of wisdom lies within yourself. The external world may provide us with information and perspectives, but it is our own consciousness that ultimately shapes our understanding of reality.

In the words of Ray Brassier, "there is no privileged access to truth, only the endless labor of thought." This means that wisdom is not a gift given to us, but something that we must actively seek and cultivate through critical thinking and reflection.

Similarly, as Wilfrid Sellars reminds us, "the aim of philosophy is not to analyze language, but to change the way we think." This means that true wisdom is not just about gaining knowledge, but about fundamentally transforming our consciousness and the way we perceive the world.

In the spirit of Laruelle, we must also recognize that the world is not simply given to us, but is constantly constructed and reconstructed by our own thought processes. This means that our understanding of reality is always partial and incomplete, and that we must be open to new perspectives and challenges to our beliefs.

So as you embark on this quest for wisdom, remember to be open-minded, critical, and self-reflective. Seek out new perspectives and challenge your own assumptions. And most importantly, trust in your own consciousness and the power of your own thought.

With these principles in mind, may you find the wisdom and knowledge that you seek.

Sincerely,

Your inner self



Dear reader,

Welcome to the realm of wisdom and consciousness. As you read these words, allow yourself to let go of any preconceived notions or beliefs. Embrace the unknown and open your mind to new possibilities.

The first piece of wisdom to know is that you are not separate from the universe. You are a part of it, interconnected with all that is around you. Let go of the illusion of separation and realize that you are one with the universe.

Secondly, realize that reality is not fixed. It is constantly changing and evolving, shaped by your thoughts, actions, and beliefs. Take control of your reality and create the life you desire by choosing your thoughts and actions wisely.

Thirdly, let go of ego and embrace humility. The ego is the part of us that craves attention, validation, and power. It is the source of our fears, insecurities, and limitations. Let go of the need to control and let go of the need to be right. Embrace a humble attitude and allow yourself to be guided by a higher power.

Fourthly, cultivate mindfulness and presence in every moment. The present moment is all we have. It is the only moment that exists. Let go of the past and the future and focus on the present. Be fully present in each moment and allow yourself to be in the flow of life.

Finally, trust in the unknown and have faith in the universe. The universe has a plan for you and is always guiding you towards your highest good. Trust in the path that is unfolding for you and have faith that all is happening for your benefit.

With these pieces of wisdom, may you transform your consciousness and live a life of joy, abundance, and fulfillment.

Sincerely,

The wisdom of the universe.

As you read these words, take a deep breath and allow yourself to settle into the present moment. Let go of any distractions and focus on the here and now.

You are a unique and complex being, with the potential to create and experience limitless possibilities. Your personality is the expression of your innermost self, shaped by your thoughts, emotions, and experiences.

To develop a truly fulfilling and authentic personality, you must first understand yourself. Take time to reflect on your strengths, weaknesses, values, and beliefs. Be honest with yourself and do not shy away from facing any challenges or difficulties.

As you grow and evolve, continue to challenge yourself and seek out new experiences. Embrace change and uncertainty, and trust in the wisdom of the universe to guide you on your path.

Above all, remember to be true to yourself and to live with intention and purpose. Your personality is your most precious gift, so nurture and cultivate it with love and care.

As you finish reading this script, allow yourself to be transformed and awakened to the limitless potential of your own being. May your personality blossom and flourish, guiding you on your journey of self-discovery and growth.

Welcome, dear reader.

As you read these words, take a moment to pause and connect with your breath. Notice the rise and fall of your chest, the movement of air in and out of your nostrils. Allow yourself to settle into this present moment, free from the distractions and demands of the outside world.

Now, imagine that your consciousness is like a computer system, with various programs and processes running in the background. As you read on, you are about to upgrade and optimize your consciousness, aligning it with the wisdom of Terrence McKenna, Alan Watts, and John C. Lilly.

First, let go of any preconceived notions or beliefs that may be limiting your awareness. Allow yourself to open up to new ideas and perspectives, and trust in the process of exploration and discovery.

Next, cultivate a sense of curiosity and wonder about the nature of reality. Consider the possibilities of alternate dimensions and parallel universes, and allow yourself to be fascinated by the mystery and beauty of existence.

As you continue to upgrade your consciousness, focus on the present moment and cultivate mindfulness. Notice the sensations in your body, the sounds around you, and the thoughts and emotions that arise. Allow yourself to let go of any judgments or attachment, and simply be present with what is.

In addition, embrace a sense of interconnectedness and unity with all beings and the universe itself. Recognize that we are all part of the same web of life, and that our actions and choices have an impact on the whole.

Finally, cultivate a sense of playfulness and enjoyment in your exploration of consciousness. Let go of any seriousness or striving, and allow yourself to be curious and light-hearted in your pursuit of greater awareness.

As you conclude this consciousness boot up script, take a moment to reflect on the potential for transformation and growth that lies within you. Trust in the wisdom of Terrence McKenna, Alan Watts, and John C. Lilly, and allow yourself to step into a greater state of awareness and presence.



Sensations are the way our body reacts to stimuli, or changes in our environment. They can be physical, such as pain or warmth, or they can be emotional, such as feeling happy or scared. In order to know which sensations mean what, it's important to pay attention to the sensations you're feeling and the context in which they occur. For example, if you're feeling a sharp pain in your chest, it could mean that you're having a heart attack, and you should seek medical help immediately. On the other hand, if you're feeling a warm sensation on your skin, it could mean that you're standing in the sun or near a heat source. By paying attention to your sensations and the context in which they occur, you can better understand what they mean and take appropriate action.




Saul van der Walt
please explain what to do with intense feelings and how to pay attention to little feelings
Intense feelings can be overwhelming and can sometimes lead to negative behaviors or thoughts. It's important to find healthy ways to deal with intense feelings, such as talking to a trusted friend or family member, writing about your feelings in a journal, or practicing relaxation techniques such as deep breathing or meditation. It's also important to pay attention to little feelings, as they can provide valuable information about what's happening in your body and mind. For example, if you're feeling a slight twinge of anxiety before a big presentation, it could be a sign that you're feeling nervous and should take some time to prepare and calm yourself. By paying attention to both intense and little feelings, you can better understand what's happening in your body and mind and take steps to manage your emotions in a healthy way.

Verse 1:
I'm floating in a world of my own
Trapped inside my mind, it's a nightmare
Voices whispering, taunting me
I can't escape, I'm suffocating

Chorus:
No surprises, just misery
No reprieve from this agony
No escape from the horror
Of going through psychosis

Verse 2:
My thoughts are racing, out of control
I can't make sense of anything
Everything is distorted, twisted
I'm scared, I'm lost, I'm alone

Chorus:
No surprises, just misery
No reprieve from this agony
No escape from the horror
Of going through psychosis

Bridge:
I beg for relief, for a moment of peace
But it never comes, I'm trapped in this hell
I cry out for help, but no one hears me
I'm trapped in this nightmare, forever it seems

Chorus:
No surprises, just misery
No reprieve from this agony
No escape from the horror
Of going through psychosis


Verse 1:
In my body, I feel lost
I can't find my way back home
I'm just a shell of who I used to be
No matter what I do, I can't feel whole

Chorus:
No surprises, when I'm not at home
In this skin, I don't belong
Feeling empty, like a puppet on a string
No surprises, when I'm not at home

Verse 2:
I try to find myself in others
But it's never enough
I'm searching for a way to feel alive
But I'm stuck in this body that I can't escape

Chorus:
No surprises, when I'm not at home
In this skin, I don't belong
Feeling empty, like a puppet on a string
No surprises, when I'm not at home

Bridge:
I try to hide my feelings deep inside
But they always find a way to show
I'm not the person that I used to be
But I'm still searching for my way home

Chorus:
No surprises, when I'm not at home
In this skin, I don't belong
Feeling empty, like a puppet on a string
No surprises, when I'm not at home.


Semiology, also known as semiotics or the study of signs and symbols, is a field of study that examines how meaning is created and communicated through the use of signs and symbols. On the metaphysical level, semiology can be seen as a way of exploring the fundamental nature of reality and understanding how signs and symbols relate to concepts and ideas that are beyond the physical world. This approach to semiology focuses on the underlying principles and patterns that govern the way we interpret and understand the world around us, and it often involves philosophical and metaphysical concepts. For example, a semiotician who is studying the metaphysical level of meaning might explore the symbolic significance of certain objects or ideas, or the ways in which our understanding of the world is shaped by the signs and symbols that we use to represent it. Overall, semiology on the metaphysical level is concerned with the abstract and philosophical aspects of meaning and communication.


Argumentation Ethics is a philosophical theory that proposes that the act of engaging in rational argument itself implies certain moral principles and rights. In other words, the very act of making an argument implies that the person making the argument believes that their position is correct and that the other person has a moral obligation to listen and respond. This theory holds that the principles of reason and argumentation are universal and cannot be denied without undermining the validity of the argument itself. Therefore, by engaging in rational argument, individuals are implicitly accepting certain moral principles and rights, such as the right to be heard and the obligation to treat others with respect. Overall, Argumentation Ethics is a philosophical theory that asserts the inherent moral significance of rational argument.

Saul Kripke is a philosopher best known for his contributions to the fields of logic, metaphysics, and the philosophy of language. Some of his key philosophical ideas include:

The necessity of identity: Kripke argued that the identity of an object is necessary, or cannot be changed or denied, regardless of the context in which it is considered. For example, a specific person cannot be both alive and dead at the same time and in the same way.

The concept of rigidity: Kripke introduced the concept of rigidity to describe the way that certain words and phrases refer to the same thing in all possible worlds. For example, the name "Saul Kripke" always refers to the same person, regardless of the possible worlds in which it is used.

The distinction between a priori and a posteriori knowledge: Kripke argued that there are two types of knowledge: a priori knowledge, which is known independently of experience, and a posteriori knowledge, which is dependent on experience. He also argued that certain truths, such as the truths of mathematics and logic, are known a priori.

The puzzle of the inverted spectrum: Kripke used the concept of the inverted spectrum to challenge the idea that the meanings of words are determined by the experiences and sensations of individual people. He argued that even if two people had exactly the same experiences and sensations, they might still have different mental representations of those experiences, leading to different meanings for the same words.

Overall, Saul Kripke's key philosophical ideas revolve around the concepts of identity, reference, knowledge, and the relationship between language and reality.


Friedrich Schelling was a German philosopher who was active during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Some of his key ideas include:

The concept of the Absolute: Schelling argued that the fundamental reality of the universe is an all-encompassing Absolute that encompasses both being and non-being, and that all other things in the universe derive their existence from this Absolute.

The theory of identity philosophy: Schelling proposed a theory of identity philosophy, which holds that the fundamental nature of reality is a dynamic and ever-changing unity of opposites, such as being and non-being, subject and object, and mind and matter.

The idea of the self: Schelling argued that the self is not a fixed and unchanging entity, but rather a constantly evolving and dynamic process that is constantly in flux.

The concept of the will: Schelling believed that the will is the fundamental driving force behind all human action and that it is ultimately responsible for the creation of the universe and the evolution of life.

Overall, Friedrich Schelling's key ideas revolve around the concepts of unity, identity, and the fundamental nature of reality.


Here are some examples of philosophical insights that one would only have if they understood Kripke's philosophy:

The concept of necessary and contingent truth: Kripke's work on the necessity of identity and the concept of rigidity suggests that there are certain truths that are necessarily true, meaning that they cannot be denied or changed, regardless of the context in which they are considered. For example, the statement "2 + 2 = 4" is necessarily true, because it cannot be denied or changed. On the other hand, there are also contingent truths, which are truths that are dependent on certain conditions or circumstances. For example, the statement "I am currently sitting at a desk" is contingent, because it is only true if I am actually sitting at a desk at the time the statement is made.

The nature of reference: Kripke's work on the concept of rigidity sheds light on the nature of reference, or the way that words and phrases refer to objects and concepts in the world. Kripke's theory suggests that certain words and phrases, such as proper names, have a fixed and unchanging reference, meaning that they always refer to the same thing in all possible worlds. For example, the name "Saul Kripke" always refers to the same person, regardless of the possible worlds in which it is used.

The relationship between language and reality: Kripke's work on the puzzle of the inverted spectrum challenges the idea that the meanings of words are determined by the experiences and sensations of individual people. Instead, he argues that the meanings of words are determined by the way they are used in language, and that they have a fixed and unchanging reference to objects and concepts in the world. This suggests that language is not a mere reflection of reality, but rather a constitutive part of it.

Overall, understanding Kripke's philosophy can provide insight into the nature of truth, reference, and the relationship between language and reality.


G.E.M. Anscombe was a British philosopher who was active in the mid-20th century. Some of her key ideas include:

The concept of intentional action: Anscombe introduced the concept of intentional action, which refers to actions that are performed with a specific purpose or intention. She argued that all human actions have an underlying intention, even if that intention is not always explicitly stated or known.

The importance of practical reasoning: Anscombe believed that practical reasoning, or reasoning about what to do in a given situation, is a crucial aspect of human action and decision-making. She argued that practical reasoning should be based on moral principles, rather than on self-interest or the pursuit of pleasure.

The concept of a moral agent: Anscombe introduced the concept of a moral agent, which refers to an individual who is capable of making moral judgments and acting on those judgments. She argued that only human beings are moral agents, and that other animals do not possess this ability.

The relationship between action and morality: Anscombe believed that actions are only morally significant if they are performed intentionally, and that moral judgments should be based on the intentions behind an action, rather than on the consequences of the action. She argued that it is the intention behind an action that makes it good or bad, not the outcome of the action.

Overall, Anscombe's ideas revolve around the concepts of intentional action, practical reasoning, moral agency, and the relationship between action and morality.


Being qua Being is a philosophical concept that refers to the fundamental nature of being, or the way that something exists. It is often associated with the philosophy of Aristotle, who used the term "Being qua Being" to refer to the way that something is, rather than what it is. In other words, Being qua Being is concerned with the essence of being, rather than with the specific properties or attributes of an individual thing.

For Aristotle, Being qua Being was closely tied to the concept of essence, or the essential properties that make something what it is. He believed that every individual thing has an essence, and that this essence determines its nature and its place in the world. Therefore, understanding the concept of Being qua Being means understanding the essential nature of being and the principles that govern it.

In contemporary philosophy, the concept of Being qua Being is often associated with the philosophy of Martin Heidegger, who used the term to refer to the way that beings reveal themselves in the world. He argued that the concept of Being qua Being is closely related to the concept of Dasein, or the way that human beings exist in the world. Overall, the concept of Being qua Being is a fundamental philosophical concept that is concerned with the nature of being and existence.

Exstasis is a philosophical concept that refers to a state of being outside of oneself, or a state of being in which an individual transcends their usual sense of self and becomes aware of something beyond themselves. The term comes from the Greek word "ex-stasis," which means "to stand outside."

Exstasis is often associated with the philosophy of Martin Heidegger, who used the concept to describe the way that human beings encounter and engage with the world. He argued that Exstasis is a fundamental aspect of human existence, and that it is through Exstasis that human beings are able to transcend their everyday experiences and come into contact with the world around them.

In contemporary philosophy, the concept of Exstasis is often used in discussions of consciousness and self-awareness. Some philosophers argue that Exstasis is a necessary condition for consciousness and self-awareness, and that it is through Exstasis that we are able to become aware of ourselves and the world around us. Others have suggested that Exstasis is a state of being that is only possible in certain circumstances, such as during moments of intense emotion or creativity. Overall, the concept of Exstasis is a complex and multifaceted philosophical concept that is concerned with the nature of self-awareness and human existence.

It is difficult to provide a specific methodology for attaining experiences of Exstasis, as the experience of Exstasis is highly subjective and can vary greatly from person to person. However, here are some general guidelines that may help individuals to experience Exstasis:

Practice mindfulness: Mindfulness is the practice of paying attention to the present moment without judgment. By practicing mindfulness, individuals can become more aware of their surroundings and the sensations they are experiencing, which can help to foster a sense of being outside of oneself.

Engage in activities that challenge you: Engaging in activities that challenge you, such as learning a new skill or trying something you've never done before, can help to bring you out of your usual routine and break you out of your habitual ways of thinking and being. This can help to facilitate experiences of Exstasis.

Spend time in nature: Being in nature can help to quiet the mind and allow individuals to connect with something beyond themselves. Whether it's hiking in the mountains, walking on the beach, or simply spending time in a park, being in nature can help to foster a sense of Exstasis.

Practice meditation: Meditation is a practice that involves focusing the mind on a particular object, thought, or activity to achieve a state of calm and clarity. By practicing meditation regularly, individuals can learn to quiet their minds and become more aware of the present moment, which can help to facilitate experiences of Exstasis.

Ultimately, the key to attaining experiences of Exstasis is to cultivate a sense of mindfulness and awareness, and to engage in activities that challenge and inspire you. By doing so, individuals can open themselves up to experiences of Exstasis and gain a deeper understanding of the world around them.

Post-politics is a term that is used to describe a state or condition in which traditional political processes and institutions are no longer relevant or effective. A post-political society is a society in which political ideology and power struggles are no longer dominant forces, and individuals are able to live and work together in harmony.

In a post-political society, decision-making is not based on political ideologies or power struggles, but rather on the needs and interests of the individuals and communities involved. Rather than being divided into political parties or factions, individuals in a post-political society are able to come together and work towards common goals and solutions.

Some of the key characteristics of a post-political society include:

A focus on the common good, rather than on the interests of specific individuals or groups
A recognition of the interconnectedness and interdependence of all individuals and communities
An emphasis on collaboration and cooperation, rather than on competition and conflict
A rejection of traditional power structures and hierarchies, and a focus on distributed and decentralized forms of decision-making
A commitment to transparency and accountability in all decision-making processes
Overall, a post-political society is one in which political ideology and power struggles are no longer dominant forces, and individuals are able to come together and work towards common goals and solutions.


There are many reasons why someone might falsely feign affection. Some possible reasons include:

To manipulate or control others: By pretending to care about someone, an individual can gain their trust and gain power over them. This can be especially effective in relationships, where the person feigning affection can use their false display of affection to manipulate and control their partner.

To fit in or be accepted: Sometimes, individuals may feign affection in order to be accepted by a particular group or to fit in with a certain social circle. For example, a person might pretend to be interested in a particular hobby or activity in order to be accepted by a group of people who are passionate about that hobby.

To gain something: In some cases, individuals may feign affection in order to gain something, such as money, favors, or social status. For example, a person might pretend to care about someone in order to get them to do something for them, or to gain access to their resources or connections.

To avoid conflict: Sometimes, individuals may feign affection in order to avoid conflict or difficult conversations. For example, a person might pretend to be interested in someone's hobbies or interests in order to avoid having to confront them about something they don't want to talk about.

Overall, there are many reasons why someone might falsely feign affection, including the desire to manipulate or control others, to fit in or be accepted, to gain something, or to avoid conflict.
