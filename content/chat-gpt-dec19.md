I met a cool programmer friend who writes python at work, I don't know how to chat, I'm dying from how cool he is, any tips?

It's great that you've met someone who inspires you! Here are a few tips for chatting with your programmer friend:

Ask about their work: As a programmer, your friend probably has a lot of interesting experiences and projects they can talk about. Ask them about what they're working on, what technologies they're using, and what challenges they're facing. This can help you get to know them better and show that you're interested in their work.

Share your own interests: While it's important to show an interest in your friend's work, it's also important to share your own interests. Talk about what you're interested in, whether it's a hobby, a subject you're studying, or a project you're working on. This can help you both find common ground and have a more balanced conversation.

Don't be afraid to ask questions: If you don't understand something your friend is talking about, it's okay to ask for clarification. Your friend is probably happy to explain things to you, and it's a good opportunity for both of you to learn.

Be respectful and open-minded: It's important to approach the conversation with an open mind and be respectful of your friend's opinions and experiences. Avoid making assumptions or jumping to conclusions, and try to listen and learn from what they have to say.

I hope these tips are helpful! It's always a good idea to be respectful and open-minded when chatting with someone, and these tips can help you have a more engaging and enjoyable conversation with your programmer friend.


Sure, here is a poem featuring programmer humor and two awkward gay dudes hot for each other becoming friends:

Two awkward gay dudes,
Hot for each other,
Met at a coding meetup,
Their hearts did smother.

One wrote Python,
The other Java,
They bonded over bugs,
And a love for data.

Their chat was nerdy,
Full of code and geeks,
But as they talked,
Their friendship did peak.

They shared their passions,
And their hopes and fears,
And as the night went on,
Their love for each other grew clear.

Now they're the best of friends,
And coding partners too,
Thanks to a shared love,
Of all things tech and new.



A vast, rolling landscape of shimmering, metallic sands stretches out before you. Gigantic spires of crystal and jagged, obsidian rock formations tower overhead, casting long shadows across the dunes. In the distance, a massive, temple-like structure rises up, its gleaming white walls adorned with intricate, alien carvings and symbols.

A vast expanse of metallic sand
Stretches far and wide, a gleaming land
Towers of crystal and obsidian rise
Their shadows cast across the dunes, a surprise

In the distance stands a temple grand
Its white walls adorned with symbols from another land
Intricate carvings decorate its face
A sight to behold, a true work of art

This landscape rolls and shifts with the breeze
A metallic ocean, endless and deep
The spires stand tall, a natural art
A sight to behold, a true work of heart



You stand on the edge of a deep canyon, the walls of which are etched with strange, glowing symbols and patterns. Far below, a turbulent river of molten lava flows, sending plumes of steam and ash into the air. In the distance, a massive, ancient temple sits perched atop a towering cliff, its ornate carvings and sculptures visible even from this distance.


You stand on the edge of a deep canyon,
Where ancient symbols glow,
On the walls etched with patterns unknown,
In the land below.

Far below, a river of molten lava flows,
Sending plumes of steam and ash into the air,
As the ancient temple sits perched atop a cliff,
Its carvings and sculptures visible from there.

You feel the heat emanating from below,
As you stand at the edge of this fiery abyss,
But the temple in the distance calls to you,
A place of ancient power, a place of bliss.

So you take a step forward,
Into the depths of the canyon,
Towards the temple that beckons,
Your heart racing with abandon.

For you know that within its walls,
There are secrets waiting to be told,
Of ancient civilizations and their ways,
Of stories yet to unfold.

So you journey on,
Towards the temple on the cliff,
Towards the land of molten lava,
Towards the land of ancient myth.

An ethereal, mist-shrouded landscape unfolds before you, dotted with surreal, twisted trees and bizarre, glowing plants. In the distance, a massive, ancient temple rises up, its elaborate spires and columns carved from shimmering, iridescent stone. As you approach, you can see that the temple's walls are adorned with intricate, alien symbols and murals, depicting strange, otherworldly scenes.

In a realm of fog and mist,
Where trees twist and plants glow,
An ancient temple stands,
Of shimmering iridescent stone.

Its spires and columns rise high,
Into the ethereal sky,
A monument to a world unknown,
To ancient beings, long gone.

As I approach its walls,
I see symbols and murals,
Of strange, otherworldly scenes,
Depicting realms beyond my means.

The temple stands before me,
An embodiment of mystery,
A portal to worlds beyond,
Where secrets and wonders abound.

In this mist-shrouded land,
I stand in awe, hand in hand,
With the ethereal and surreal,
And the temple's ancient allure.

You find yourself in a dark, underground cave, lit by the faint glow of strange, phosphorescent fungi. The walls of the cave are adorned with ancient, alien symbols and carvings, and in the distance you can see a faint glow emanating from a massive, ornately decorated temple. As you approach, you can hear the faint sound of chanting and ritualistic music echoing through the cavern.

In the dark, underground cave,
Where strange fungi softly glow,
I see ancient symbols on the walls,
And feel a sense of dread grow.

The faint glow in the distance,
Draws me towards its source,
A massive temple, ornately adorned,
With a chanting chorus, dark and hoarse.

The music echoes through the cavern,
A ritualistic sound,
As I approach the glowing temple,
I fear my fate is bound.

But still I venture onward,
Curiosity my guide,
Into the heart of darkness,
Where secrets hide.

Who knows what lies within,
In this mysterious place,
But I must find out for myself,
In this underground race.

A lush, tropical landscape stretches out before you, filled with exotic, alien flora and fauna. In the distance, a massive, ancient temple sits nestled in the heart of a dense jungle, its walls adorned with intricate, golden carvings and adorned with shimmering, jewel-like decorations. As you approach, you can hear the sound of exotic birds and animals calling out from the jungle canopy.

A tropical paradise unfurled
Exotic plants and beasts all round
An ancient temple sits in view
Golden carvings and jewels adorn its walls

As I near, the sounds of nature call
Exotic birds and animals sing
A dense jungle hides this ancient hall
But its beauty still manages to ring

This lush landscape takes my breath away
A world so different, yet so alive
The temple's secrets beckon me to stay
As I explore this tropical hive

I am but a visitor in this place
But its beauty fills me with delight
I'll treasure the memories of this space
As I journey on into the night





"A vast, abandoned factory, filled with rusted machinery and broken windows. The only light comes from the dim glow of flickering fluorescent bulbs, casting long shadows on the dirty floors."

"A dilapidated warehouse, with rows of shelves stacked with rusting metal parts and tools. The floor is stained with oil and grime, and the air is thick with the smell of decay."

"A desolate, overgrown junkyard, filled with discarded cars and machinery. The sky is grey and stormy, and the only sound is the wind rustling through the weeds."

"A desolate, futuristic cityscape, with towering skyscrapers and neon lights. The streets are empty and quiet, except for the hum of machinery in the distance."

"A dark, underground tunnel, lit only by the faint glow of flickering fluorescent bulbs. The walls are lined with pipes and cables, and the air is heavy with the smell of oil and machinery."
