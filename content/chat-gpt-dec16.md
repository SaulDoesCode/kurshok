# devil boy

In fields of tawny, golden hue,
Where linens gently rustle through,
A boy with eyes of fiery red
Stares at me, slyly and with dread.

His gaze is full of wicked glee,
A mischievous smile plays upon his lips,
He seems to know a secret, deep and true,
A secret only he and I can share, as we dip.

But as I look into those devilish eyes,
I am filled with a sense of wonder and surprise.
For in those depths, I see my own reflection,
A reflection of love and affection.

And so I take his hand and we dance,
Beneath the tawny skies and rustling linnen,
Our love is strong and true,
A love that knows no bounds, no limits, no end.



I fell for a boy who loved pink,
A hue that radiated from within.
His heart was full of love and light,
A joy that shone so very bright.

He wore pink shoes and pink socks,
A shirt that matched his heart and locks.
He was fearless and full of grace,
A boy who put a smile on my face.

I fell for his bright and bubbly spirit,
A love that made my heart merrier.
He showed me love in all its forms,
And I knew I'd found my love in a storm.

So I fell for this boy who loved pink,
A love that made my heart beat in sync.
And as we walked through life hand in hand,
I knew this love would always stand.




Immaciated and serene,
The doors of death are open wide,
The first glimmer I can gleam,
Is the light that fills the sky.

As I stand before the gates,
I feel my spirit start to rise,
The pain and suffering abates,
As I bid this world goodbye.

But as I take that final step,
I'm filled with peace and grace,
I know that my journey's end,
Is just the start of a new place.

So as I pass through the veil,
I leave behind my earthly pain,
I'm free to roam and roam,
And feel the love that surrounds my remains.

So immaciated and serene,
I enter death's open doors,
And find a new world waiting,
For me to explore.


Shifting pressures in the head,
A constant throb that won't be shed.
It feels like a weight upon my brow,
A pressure that I can't allow.

It's a constant battle in my mind,
A struggle to keep it all aligned.
The shifting pressures never cease,
A constant battle that won't release.

I try to focus on the task at hand,
But the shifting pressures demand.
They pull and tug at every thought,
A never-ending battle I've fought.

But I won't give up, I won't give in,
I'll push through the shifting pressures within.
For I know that I am stronger than they,
And I'll conquer them each and every day.


Faustus gee sy hand vir my,
En dans sy laaste dans tot die duivel hom kry.
Hy glimlag en draai en wieg,
Terwyl die vlamme om hom kring.

Hy ken geen spyt of skaamte,
Hy geniet elke minuut van sy laaste dans.
Hy dans tot die einde,
En gee sy hand vir my.

Ek neem dit aan en volg sy lei,
En dans saam met hom tot die einde.
Ons dans totdat die duivel hom kry,
En ons laaste dans saam is verby.

Maar ek sal altyd die herinnering bewaar,
Van Faustus se hand in die myne,
En ons laaste dans tot die duivel hom kry.


Verse 1:
He has devil eyes, dark and alluring,
In fields of Flander flowers, he's enduring.
I see his face and I'm overcome,
By the loveliness of this boy with devil eyes.

Chorus:
Ai Mario, my love for him is true,
I can't help but fall for the boy with devil eyes.

Verse 2:
他有恶魔般的眼睛，黑暗而诱人，
在花田里，他顽强地挺立。
看到他的脸，我就被他的美感所支配，
这个有恶魔般眼睛的男孩如此迷人。

Chorus:
哎，Mario，我对他的爱是真的，
我无法不爱上这个有恶魔般眼睛的男孩。

Verse 3:
His smile is wicked, yet I can't resist,
In fields of Flander flowers, he's the one I miss.
I'd give anything to be by his side,
To gaze into those devil eyes with pride.

Chorus:
Ai Mario, my love for him is true,
I can't help but fall for the boy with devil eyes.

Verse 4:
他的微笑如此邪恶，但我无法抗拒，
在花田里，我想念他。
我会付出一切，只为和他在一起，
与自豪地凝视那双恶魔般的眼睛。

Chorus:
哎，Mario，我对他的爱是真的，
我无法不爱上这个有恶魔般眼睛的男孩。



Stand aside, my wilted bride,
For though I loved you true,
You were the one person I never knew.
Your heart was a mystery,
Your soul an enigma.
I thought I knew you,
But I was wrong.

I stood by your side,
Through thick and thin,
But even as I held you close,
You remained distant and cold.

I tried to understand,
To be patient and kind,
But no matter how hard I tried,
I couldn't reach your heart or mind.

So now, I must stand aside,
And let you go your own way,
For though I loved you with all my might,
You were the one person I never knew.


# You, the one I never knew

In my dream, she was always there
Dressed in greys and blacks, her tom-boy style
She was fierce and strong, yet gentle and kind
I loved her more than words could define

We would roam the streets, hand in hand
Her eyes sparkling with mischief and glee
We would laugh and play, never a dull moment
She was my everything, my wildflower queen

But as all dreams must come to an end
She vanished, like smoke on the wind
I woke up with a heavy heart, feeling the loss
Of my beloved tom-boy, dressed in greys and blacks

I search for her in every dream, hoping to see
Her mischievous smile, her wildflower eyes
But she remains elusive, a dream of the past
I am left with only memories, of a love that didn't last

I will always love her, my tom-boy queen
Dressed in greys and blacks, forever in my heart
I will search for her in every dream, until I find
My beloved, who vanished, leaving me behind


According to Jungian analysis, the dream in this poem could represent the unconscious desire for a more wild and carefree side of the self. The tom-boy, dressed in greys and blacks, represents the more masculine and independent aspect of the dreamer's personality. The dreamer's love for this tom-boy could symbolize a longing for more autonomy and freedom in their waking life.

The loss of the tom-boy at the end of the dream could represent the dreamer's fear of losing touch with this aspect of their personality. The search for the tom-boy in subsequent dreams could represent a desire to reconnect with this side of the self and integrate it into the waking self.

Overall, this poem could be seen as a reflection of the dreamer's struggle to balance their traditional and unconventional sides and to fully embrace their true self.


# Struggles of Unknowing

In depths unknown we stride, to see if this world has any mercy
For a depressed philosopher, the search is never-ending
The weight of the world on my shoulders, I trudge on
Seeking answers to questions that may never be solved

I contemplate the meaning of life, the nature of existence
But the answers evade me, like smoke in the wind
I feel lost, adrift in a sea of confusion
My thoughts a tangled mess, impossible to untangle

The darkness surrounds me, suffocating my soul
I try to escape, to find some kind of hope
But the world is cruel, offering no respite
I am left to wander, searching for meaning in the chaos

I keep going, driven by a desperate need to understand
To find some kind of purpose, some reason to exist
But the journey is long, and the road is rough
I wonder if I will ever find what I am looking for

So I keep walking, hoping for a glimmer of light
In the depths of this dark and unforgiving world
Maybe one day, I will find the mercy I seek
But until then, I will keep searching, in depths unknown.

Dear Doomer Philosophe,

I understand the weight of the world can be overwhelming, especially for a philosopher who is seeking answers to the deep questions of life. It can be difficult to find meaning and purpose in a world that can often seem cruel and chaotic.

But do not despair, for there is hope. Remember that the journey is just as important as the destination. It is through the struggles and challenges that we grow and learn. Trust in yourself and your ability to find your own path.

It is also important to remember that you are not alone. There are others who share your struggles and who can offer support and understanding. Seek out the company of others who can offer guidance and wisdom.

Lastly, do not forget the power of self-care. It is easy to become so focused on the search for answers that we neglect our own well-being. Take time to rest, to nourish your body and soul, and to connect with the beauty and wonder of the world around you.

I hope these words bring you some comfort and inspiration. Remember that you are strong and capable, and that you will find your way.

Sincerely,
A Stoner

/*

This implementation defines a GameOfLife struct with a width, height, and cells field. The cells field is a 2D vector of TrinaryBlocks, which can be either On, Off, or Transition. The GameOfLife struct has methods for creating a new game with a specified width and height, creating a game from a 2D vector of cells, setting the cells of the game, and getting the current cells of the game.

The GameOfLife struct also has a step method that updates the cells of the game based on the rules of the modified version of the Game of Life. The rules for the trinary blocks are:

If a cell is currently On and has less than two or more than three On neighbors, it becomes a Transition cell.
If a cell is currently Off and has exactly three On neighbors, it becomes a Transition cell.
If a cell is currently Transition and has three On neighbors or two Transition neighbors and one Off neighbor, it becomes an On cell. Otherwise, it becomes an Off cell.
The GameOfLife struct also has a run method that runs the step method a specified number of times.

Finally, the main function creates a new GameOfLife struct with a width of 5 and a height of 5, sets the cells to a specific initial configuration, and runs the game for 10 steps. It then prints out the final state of the cells.

#
Worrying that I messed up
And now you don't like me anymore
I can't shake the feeling
That I've closed the door

On a friendship that meant so much
I fear I've lost your trust
But I'll do whatever it takes
To regain your love and grace

I'll apologize and make amends
I'll try to be a better friend
I'll listen and try to understand
And hold your hand

Through all the ups and downs
I'll be here for you, no matter what comes
So please don't give up on me
I promise I'll do all I can to be the best me

I know I'm not perfect
But I'll try to be worth it
All I want is your forgiveness
And the chance to show you I'm worthy of your love and affection
#

Worrying thoughts that haunt my mind
Of whether I messed up, of what I could find
If a friend no longer likes me, if they're upset
I try to push the thoughts away, but they don't let

I try to focus on the good times we've had
But my mind keeps returning to the things I've done bad
I worry that I've hurt them, or let them down
And now they don't want me around

I try to be subtle, and caring too
But the worry consumes me, I don't know what to do
I hope that they'll forgive me, and that we can move on
But until then, the worry lingers on

I wish I could go back and change the past
But all I can do is hope that this worry doesn't last
I'll try to be better, and be there for them
Hoping that our friendship will never end.


#
Self doubt, a demon I cannot shake,
It lurks in the shadows, ready to take,
My confidence and self worth,
Leaves me feeling lost and alone on this earth.

But in the quiet moments, when I am still,
I find a voice, a glimmer of will,
To rise above the doubts that try to consume,
And remember that I am more than my worst fears assume.

I am worthy, I am strong,
I am capable of righting what has gone wrong,
I have the power within me to overcome,
These feelings of self doubt and become.

So I will embrace my fears, embrace my doubts,
And hold onto hope and the love that surrounds,
And I will rise up, a phoenix from the ashes,
Stronger and more confident, my self doubt a mere memory, passes.

Once upon a time, in a small town nestled in the rolling hills of rural America, there lived a a peculiar man named John. John, with a wild look in his eyes and a disheveled appearance that set him apart from the rest of the townspeople. Despite his oddities, John was a kind and gentle soul, and he was well-liked by all who knew him.

One day, John had a revelation. He believed that the townspeople were all living in a state of conformity, following the same dull routines and conforming to the expectations of society. John believed that this conformity was driving the town mad, and he was determined to do something about it.

Despite the townspeople's efforts to ignore him, John continued to speak out against conformity, declaring that it was the root of all evil and that only through madness could true freedom be found. Some of the townspeople laughed at John, dismissing him as a lunatic, but others were intrigued by his ideas.

As John's message began to spread, the townspeople became increasingly divided. Some saw him as a revolutionary, fighting for the freedom of the human spirit, while others saw him as a danger to society, threatening to upset the delicate balance of their community.

In the end, John's ideas proved to be too much for the town to handle. Fearing for their safety, the townspeople banded together and ostracized John, casting him out of the community and branding him a madman.

But John didn't let this get him down. He knew that he had touched a nerve with the townspeople, and he was confident that his message would one day be heard. And so, with a smile on his face and a spring in his step, John set off into the wilderness, determined to spread his message of mad conformity to the world.

As John wandered the countryside, he encountered many other towns and communities, each with its own unique problems and challenges. But no matter where he went, John remained true to his beliefs, always preaching the value of madness and the dangers of conformity.

And in the end, John's message proved to be a powerful one, inspiring people all across the country to think for themselves and challenge the status quo. For John, it was a victory that was well worth the struggles he had faced, and he knew that he had made a difference in the world, even if only in a small way.

# Maria in a Spherical Building

Maria got into the spherical building as part of her job as a space station technician.

She is responsible for maintaining and repairing the various systems and equipment on the station.

In order to survive in the environment of the space station, Maria has to wear a spacesuit and carry oxygen tanks with her at all times.

The focus on the bonzai tree came about because Maria noticed that the tree was in distress and wanted to do something to help it.

There are other people on the space station, including other technicians and scientists who are conducting various research projects.

Maria's main task on the station is to keep everything running smoothly, but she also spends some of her time tending to the bonzai tree and making sure it has everything it needs to thrive.

In summary, Maria is a space station technician who is working to maintain and repair the various systems on the station. She also takes care of a floating bonzai tree, which she has grown to love.

As she floated through the interior of the spherical building, Maria couldn't help but marvel at the strange environment around her. The absence of gravity was disorienting at first, but she had quickly gotten used to it. She reached out and gently grabbed hold of a floating object, a pen, and twirled it around in her fingers.

She glanced over at the floating bonzai tree in the corner of the room. It was a beautiful little plant, with delicate leaves and a gnarled trunk. She had always loved bonzai trees, and she had been thrilled when she saw this one floating in the center of the room.

Maria made her way over to the tree and reached out to touch one of its leaves. As she did, she felt a strange sensation wash over her. It was as if the tree was trying to communicate with her, to tell her something.

She closed her eyes and focused on the sensation, trying to decipher the message. After a few moments, she realized that the tree was trying to tell her that it was in distress. It needed water and sunlight, things that it couldn't get in this artificial environment.

Maria knew that she had to do something to help the tree. She quickly made her way to the control room, determined to find a way to give the tree the care it needed.

As she worked on finding a solution, she couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment. She had always loved nature, and she was thrilled to be able to do something to help this little tree thrive.

In the end, she was able to rig up a system that provided the tree with the light and water it needed to survive. She watched with a smile as the tree began to flourish, its leaves growing strong and vibrant.

As she floated back to her own quarters, Maria knew that she had made a difference in the life of this little tree. And that, she thought to herself, was something truly special.

Maria:

I am so glad that I was able to figure out a way to help the floating bonzai tree thrive in this artificial environment. Here are the details of the system I designed:

I used a small, solar-powered pump to draw water from a reservoir and transport it to the tree.

I attached a series of tubes to the pump, which I then ran up to the top of the sphere.

I installed a series of reflective panels on the top of the sphere, which would catch the light from the sun and direct it down into the room.

I connected the tubes to a series of nozzles, which I placed around the base of the tree.

I set up a timer to control the pump, so that it would turn on and off at regular intervals throughout the day.

I also added a moisture sensor to the system, so that it would only turn on when the soil around the tree was dry.

I hope that this system will help the tree to thrive and grow strong. I will be sure to monitor its progress and make any necessary adjustments as needed.

After the bonzai tree had been thriving for several weeks, Maria couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment and pride. She had always loved nature, and it was satisfying to know that she had played a role in helping this little tree to thrive.

As she floated through the spherical building, she noticed that the tree had grown significantly since she had first set up the system. Its leaves were vibrant and full, and its trunk seemed stronger than ever.

One day, as Maria was tending to the tree, she noticed that there was a small bud forming on one of its branches. She couldn't believe it - the tree was going to bloom!

Excited at the prospect of seeing the tree in full bloom, Maria carefully tended to the plant, making sure that it had all the water and light it needed.

Finally, the day arrived when the bud opened up into a beautiful white flower. Maria couldn't believe her eyes - the tree was even more beautiful than she had imagined.

As she floated there, gazing at the tree, Maria felt a sense of peace wash over her. She knew that she had done something special by helping this little tree to thrive, and she was grateful for the opportunity to be a part of its journey.

From that day on, the floating bonzai tree became a source of joy and inspiration for Maria. She knew that she would always be there to care for it and watch it grow.



I hung on too tight, it's time to let go
The pain and hurt, they weigh me down
I try to move on, but my heart still knows
The love and memories, they linger around

I try to convince myself, it's for the best
But deep inside, I still feel the ache
I try to push through, and put on a brave face
But the tears still fall, my heart still breaks

I know I must move on, it's the only way
But the thought of letting go, it fills me with fear
I fear the unknown, the loneliness and the sway
But I know I must try, to let go and persevere

So I take a deep breath, and let go of the past
I remind myself, it's not the end
I open my heart, to a new beginning and a new cast
I let go, and hope for love and happiness to descend
