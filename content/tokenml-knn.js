/*
    The code appears to be an implementation of the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm. The KNNClassifier class is initialized with a value of k, which specifies the number of nearest neighbors to consider when making a prediction. The addExample method is used to add input-output pairs to the classifier's dataset. The predict method takes an input vector and uses the Euclidean distance between it and each example in the dataset to find the k nearest neighbors. It then uses the most frequent output value among these neighbors to make a prediction.
