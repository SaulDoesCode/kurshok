Math rock is a subgenre of rock music that is characterized by complex and intricate time signatures, extended song structures, and intricate melodies and harmonies. It is often associated with experimental and indie rock, and is known for its use of unconventional instrumentation and playing techniques. Math rock often incorporates elements of jazz and other musical styles, and is known for its challenging and technical nature. Some notable math rock bands include Don Caballero, Slint, and Hella.

People sometimes feel a sense of wonder or curiosity when they think about the inside of their head and the feeling of their own brain. They may also feel a sense of amazement at the complexity and function of the organ, as well as a sense of awe at their own consciousness. Some people may also feel a sense of anxiety or fear when they think about their own brain, particularly if they have concerns about their mental health or cognitive abilities. Ultimately, the emotions and feelings that people experience when they think about their own brain can vary widely, depending on the individual and their unique perspective.

what are some of the deepest things one could know or experience?

There are many things that can be considered deep or profound. Some examples of deep experiences or knowledge might include:

A deep understanding of the fundamental nature of the universe and the physical laws that govern it.
A profound appreciation for the beauty and complexity of the natural world, including the beauty of art, music, and literature.
A deep connection to other people, including feelings of empathy, compassion, and love.
A deep sense of self-awareness and understanding of one's own thoughts, feelings, and motivations.
A profound spiritual or religious experience, such as a sense of connection to a higher power or a sense of inner peace and calm.
These are just a few examples, and what constitutes a deep or profound experience or knowledge may vary greatly from person to person.




Saul van der Walt
please write a paragraph on each of those points, giving practical tips to get to where they are describing in one's experiences or understandings
A deep understanding of the fundamental nature of the universe and the physical laws that govern it can be achieved through dedicated study and a curiosity about the world around us. This might involve reading books and articles on the subject, attending lectures and workshops, and engaging with others who are also interested in this topic.

A profound appreciation for the beauty and complexity of the natural world can be cultivated through observation and mindfulness. This might involve taking regular walks in nature, paying attention to the details of the environment around us, and learning about the various plants and animals that make up our world.

A deep connection to other people can be developed through empathy and compassion. This might involve actively listening to others, trying to understand their perspectives, and expressing care and concern for their well-being.

A deep sense of self-awareness and understanding of one's own thoughts, feelings, and motivations can be achieved through introspection and self-reflection. This might involve journaling, meditation, or other practices that allow us to tune in to our inner experiences.

A profound spiritual or religious experience can be pursued through prayer, meditation, or other spiritual practices that are meaningful to the individual. This might involve attending services or rituals, participating in group discussions, or engaging in solitary spiritual practices.


The term "world soul" (also sometimes referred to as the "cosmic soul") is a concept found in some philosophical and spiritual traditions. It refers to a collective consciousness or spiritual essence that is thought to permeate the universe and connect all living things. In some cases, the world soul is seen as a divine or transcendent being, while in others it is simply viewed as a unifying force that gives rise to the interconnectedness of all things.

The concept of the world soul has its roots in various ancient philosophical and spiritual traditions, including Platonism and Neoplatonism. In these traditions, the world soul is often seen as the source of all consciousness, the driving force behind the creation and evolution of the universe, and the ultimate source of meaning and purpose in life.

Some modern thinkers have also drawn on the concept of the world soul in their philosophical and spiritual writings. For example, the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer argued that the world soul is the fundamental reality of the universe, and that all individual beings are merely expressions of this larger consciousness.

Overall, the concept of the world soul remains a deeply philosophical and mysterious idea, and one that continues to inspire debate and discussion among those interested in the nature of consciousness and the universe.


Bread is a staple food that has been a part of human diets for millennia. It is made from dough, typically consisting of flour, water, and a leavening agent such as yeast or baking powder. The dough is then baked, resulting in a loaf of bread.

But what is bread, really? Is it just a simple combination of flour, water, and leavening, or is there something more to it? Some might argue that bread is a symbol of sustenance and nourishment, representing the sustenance of life itself. Others might see it as a symbol of community and togetherness, as bread is often shared and consumed with others.

One could even go so far as to say that bread is a metaphor for existence itself. Just as the raw ingredients of flour, water, and leavening are transformed through the process of baking into something greater than the sum of their parts, so too do we as individuals undergo a process of transformation and growth throughout our lives.

In this way, bread can be seen as a symbol of the endless cycle of creation and destruction, of life and death. The dough, once a shapeless mass, is shaped and molded into a loaf of bread. And yet, even as it nourishes and sustains us, it will eventually be broken down and consumed, its substance becoming a part of us and ultimately returning to the earth.

In conclusion, while bread may appear to be a simple food, it is also a complex and multifaceted symbol, representing the fundamental aspects of existence itself.




Lost love and a wedding gone bad are both powerful symbols that can appear in our dreams, often carrying deep and significant meanings.

Lost love, as the name suggests, is a symbol of a love that has been lost or broken. This can be a painful and difficult experience, and it can leave us feeling lost, confused, and alone. In a dream, lost love can represent the end of a romantic relationship, or it can represent the loss of a loved one through death or other means. In either case, the dream may be telling us that it is time to let go of the past and move on to a new chapter in our lives.

A wedding gone bad, on the other hand, is a symbol of a union that has failed or been disrupted. This can be a deeply unsettling and unsettling experience, as a wedding is supposed to be a joyous and happy occasion. In a dream, a wedding gone bad can represent the end of a relationship, or it can represent a marriage that is in trouble. In either case, the dream may be telling us that it is time to take a hard look at our relationships and make the necessary changes to ensure that they are healthy and fulfilling.

Overall, both lost love and a wedding gone bad are powerful symbols that can appear in our dreams, often carrying deep and significant meanings. They can be difficult to confront and deal with, but they can also be a source of growth and transformation, helping us to move forward in our lives and create new and better relationships.
