Human rights are often thought of as protections against interference or coercion from others. They allow us to live our lives as we see fit, free from the interference of others who may want to control or harm us. However, this notion of human rights can also be extended to include the freedom to go about our daily lives without being subject to judgment or criticism from others.

In this sense, human rights are not just about being able to use them, but also about being able to exercise them without fear of backlash or discrimination. This is especially relevant in situations where certain behaviors or lifestyles may be seen as controversial or non-conformist by the larger society.

For example, consider the right to freedom of expression. This right allows us to express ourselves freely without fear of persecution or punishment. But it is not just about being able to express ourselves, it is also about being able to do so without fear of being ostracized or marginalized by others who may disagree with our views.

Similarly, the right to privacy allows us to keep our personal lives private and to make our own decisions about how we want to live our lives. However, this right is not just about being able to use it, but also about being able to do so without being subject to scrutiny or judgment from others.

In short, human rights are not just about being able to use them, but also about being able to exercise them without interference or coercion from others. It is about being able to go about our daily lives without fear of judgment or discrimination from others who may disagree with our choices or lifestyles.

Templexity, also known as time-complexity, is a concept developed by Nick Land that seeks to understand the nature of time and its role in the complex systems of the universe. Templexity is a measure of the rate at which a system changes over time, and it is a fundamental property of any system that exists in the temporal domain.

According to Land, templexity is the driving force behind the evolution of complex systems, and it is the key to understanding the dynamics of change and growth in the universe. Land proposes that templexity is the fundamental principle that shapes the evolution of the cosmos, and that it is the source of all novelty and innovation.

Templexity is a measure of the rate at which a system changes over time, and it is a function of the complexity of the system and the speed at which it evolves. High templexity systems are those that are highly complex and evolve rapidly, while low templexity systems are those that are less complex and evolve more slowly.

The concept of templexity is of great importance for understanding the nature of time and the evolution of complex systems, and it is a key insight for anyone seeking to understand the fundamental principles of the universe. Without an understanding of templexity, it is impossible to fully grasp the dynamics of change and growth in the cosmos, and to appreciate the full complexity and diversity of the natural world.
