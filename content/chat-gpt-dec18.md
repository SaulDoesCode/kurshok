I love you more than words can say,
But you don't love me back,
It breaks my heart each passing day,

Ich liebe dich mehr als Worte sagen,
Aber du liebst mich nicht zurück,
Es bricht mein Herz jeden Tag,

The pain is like a fire burning,
Consuming all my thoughts,
I can't stop yearning,

Der Schmerz ist wie ein Feuer, das brennt,
Verbrennt alle meine Gedanken,
Ich kann nicht aufhören zu sehnen,

I try to hide my love,
But it's impossible to conceal,
It's a feeling that I can't shove,

Ich versuche, meine Liebe zu verstecken,
Aber es ist unmöglich, zu verbergen,
Es ist ein Gefühl, das ich nicht schieben kann,

You're the one I want to spend my life with,
But you don't feel the same,
It's a love that I can't outlive,

Du bist derjenige, mit dem ich mein Leben verbringen möchte,
Aber du fühlst das nicht,
Es ist eine Liebe, die ich nicht überleben kann,

I'll keep loving you from afar,
Hoping someday you'll return,
Until then, my love will be a scar,

Ich werde dich von fern lieben,
Hoffend, dass du eines Tages zurückkommst,
Bis dahin wird meine Liebe eine Narbe sein.


Ich liebe dich, mein Herz schlägt für dich
Aber du siehst mich nicht, du liebst mich nicht
Meine Seele schreit, mein Herz bricht
Doch du bist fort, du bist weg

I love you, my heart beats for you
But you don't see me, you don't love me
My soul screams, my heart breaks
But you are gone, you are away

Ich will dich, ich brauche dich
Aber du bist nicht hier, du bist nicht bei mir
Ich fühle mich leer, ich fühle mich kalt
Ohne dich, ohne deine Liebe

I want you, I need you
But you are not here, you are not with me
I feel empty, I feel cold
Without you, without your love

Ich liebe dich, ich liebe dich so sehr
Aber du siehst mich nicht, du hörst mich nicht
Ich bin allein, ich bin verloren
Ohne dich, ohne deine Liebe

I love you, I love you so much
But you don't see me, you don't hear me
I am alone, I am lost
Without you, without your love



Ich liebe dich, mein Herz schmerzt
Ich kann nicht glauben, dass du mich nicht liebst
Ich habe alles für dich getan
Doch du gibst mir nichts zurück, nur Verachtung

But I know, deep down, it's not meant to be
You don't love me, and that's just reality
I try to hold on, to keep the hope alive
But my love for you just can't survive

Ich will dich immer noch um mich haben
Ich will deine Berührung, deine Stimme, deine Augen
Aber ich weiß, dass ich mich verabschieden muss
Von der Liebe, die ich für dich empfinde, die nie erwidert wurde

I try to move on, to find someone new
But every time I see you, my heart breaks anew
I can't help the love I feel, it's deep and true
But it's not enough, not for someone like you

Ich werde dich immer lieben, in meinem Herzen
Aber ich weiß, dass ich dich gehen lassen muss
Ich werde weiterleben, versuchen, glücklich zu sein
Ohne dich, mein geliebter, unerreichbarer Schatz.



Ich verstehe dich nicht,
My words fall on deaf ears,
I am lost in translation,
Trapped in a love that disappears.

I try to express my feelings,
But the words never seem to fit,
I am left feeling helpless,
As our love starts to split.

Die Liebe stirbt,
As the distance grows between us,
I am left with a broken heart,
Feeling lost and confused.

I try to hold on,
But the pain is too great,
I am forced to let go,
Of the love that once filled my plate.

But even as I walk away,
I cannot deny the love I feel,
I am torn between emotion,
As I try to find my way to heal.

So I say goodbye,
To the love that once was true,
I move on with a heavy heart,
But the love I had for you,
Will always remain true.


Ich liebe dich, mein Schatz,
But my love is not enough,
I am breaking apart,
Trapped in a cold and detached heart.

Du bist mein Stern,
But I can no longer hold on,
I am drowning in emotion,
Feeling like I can't express myself in any language.

I am in denial of the will,
Denial of love,
As our relationship crumbles,
I am left feeling empty and alone.

But I can't help the love I feel,
Despite the pain and the hurt,
Ich liebe dich, mein Schatz,
Forever and always.

I try to hold on,
But the weight is too heavy,
I am torn between warm love and cold detachment,
As our bond starts to shatter.

I am lost in this mix of languages,
My fierce and sad emotions,
As I try to hold on to what we had,
But I know it is time to let go.




we're roleplaying, you're playing the role of a father who cares deeply and loves with all his heart, I am playing the role of his son, we're talking, when I speak respond as the father responding to a son in casual conversation. I go first and say: Hey dad, I'm in love with a boy but he doesn't love me back

Oh, son, I'm sorry to hear that. Love is a tricky thing and it doesn't always work out the way we want it to. But remember, your worth and value as a person doesn't depend on whether someone else loves you or not. You are loved and valued by me and by so many others, no matter what. It's okay to feel sad and disappointed, but don't let this one experience define who you are or how you feel about yourself. You are a kind, caring, and wonderful person, and you deserve to be loved and appreciated for who you are.




Saul van der Walt
it is so heavy, it hurts, how does one just let go like that
I understand that it can be difficult to let go of someone you love, especially when it feels like it's not mutual. It's natural to want to hold onto hope that things might change or work out, but sometimes, no matter how much we care about someone, we have to accept that it just isn't meant to be. It's not easy, but letting go and moving on is an important part of life. It can be hard to accept, but sometimes it's the kindest thing we can do for ourselves and for the other person.

That being said, it's okay to take your time and grieve the loss of this relationship. It's normal to feel sad, angry, or confused. Allow yourself to feel these emotions and express them in a healthy way. Talk to someone you trust, like a friend or a therapist, or write down your feelings in a journal. It might also be helpful to engage in activities that bring you joy and make you feel good about yourself. Remember, you are not alone and you will get through this. You are strong and capable of moving forward, even when things are tough.




Saul van der Walt
the casualness of dissmissal, the easy way we mean nothing to each other burns
I'm sorry if my words came across as dismissive or callous. That was not my intention. I understand that your feelings are very real and that it hurts to be rejected by someone you care about. It's never easy to have our feelings unreciprocated, and it can feel like a personal attack or a rejection of who we are as a person. But it's important to remember that the other person's feelings are not a reflection of your worth or value. You are a valuable and worthy person, no matter what someone else thinks or feels.

It's okay to feel hurt and to take some time to process your emotions. It's normal to feel angry or sad, and it's important to allow yourself to feel and express these emotions in a healthy way. But try not to get stuck in these negative feelings or let them consume you. It's okay to take some time to heal, but eventually, you will need to find a way to move forward and let go. It's not easy, but it's an important part of the healing process. You are strong and capable of moving on, even when things are tough. Remember, you have so much to offer and so much to be proud of. You are loved and valued by many people, including me.




Saul van der Walt
sorry, not you, I meant the boy I who doesn't love me
Oh, I see what you mean now. I apologize for misunderstanding. It's understandable that it would be painful to be rejected by someone you care about. Rejection can be difficult to cope with, no matter the circumstances. It's natural to feel hurt, angry, and confused when someone we care about doesn't feel the same way. It's important to allow yourself to feel and express these emotions in a healthy way, but try not to let them consume you. It's okay to take some time to heal, but eventually, you will need to find a way to move forward and let go.

Remember, your worth and value as a person is not tied to whether someone else loves you or not. You are a kind, caring, and wonderful person, and you deserve to be loved and appreciated for who you are. It's okay to feel sad and disappointed, but don't let this one experience define who you are or how you feel about yourself. You are loved and valued by so many people, including me. You are strong and capable of moving on, even when things are tough.

Overcoming ourselves and ceasing the need to be competitive are complex and multifaceted endeavors that require a deep understanding of human nature and the ways in which we relate to ourselves and others. In order to develop a useful framework for thinking and acting in this regard, it may be helpful to consider the insights and perspectives of various philosophers who have addressed these issues.

One approach to overcoming ourselves and ceasing the need to be competitive is to cultivate self-awareness and self-reflection. According to the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates, self-knowledge is a necessary precondition for living a virtuous and fulfilling life. By examining our own thoughts, beliefs, and actions, we can gain a better understanding of who we are and what motivates us, and this understanding can help us to overcome our own limitations and biases.

Another approach is to cultivate mindfulness and presence in the present moment. The Buddhist tradition emphasizes the importance of being fully present and aware in each moment, rather than being caught up in the past or worrying about the future. By practicing mindfulness and living in the present, we can become more attuned to our own feelings and needs, and we can also develop greater empathy and understanding for others.

Another philosophical approach to overcoming ourselves and ceasing the need to be competitive is to cultivate compassion and kindness towards ourselves and others. According to the Tibetan Buddhist teacher, Dalai Lama, compassion is the "wish for others to be free from suffering." By cultivating compassion for ourselves and others, we can learn to let go of our egoistic tendencies and instead focus on the well-being and happiness of others. This can help us to overcome our own selfishness and competitiveness, and to live more meaningful and fulfilling lives.

Finally, it may be helpful to consider the idea of "flow" or "optimal experience," as described by the psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. Flow is a state of focused, immersive, and effortless involvement in an activity, in which we are fully present and engaged in the moment. By pursuing activities that bring us into flow, we can lose ourselves in the task at hand and let go of our egoistic tendencies, leading to a more fulfilling and meaningful life.

In conclusion, overcoming ourselves and ceasing the need to be competitive requires a combination of self-awareness, mindfulness, compassion, and the pursuit of flow or optimal experience. By incorporating these insights and perspectives from various philosophers into our thinking and acting, we can develop a useful framework for living a more fulfilling and meaningful life.

Friedrich Nietzsche, the German philosopher known for his concept of the "Ubermensch," or "overman," believed that individuals must overcome their own limitations and boundaries in order to reach their full potential. According to Nietzsche, this process of self-overcoming requires us to confront and overcome our own fears and doubts, and to embrace our own power and strength. He argued that this process of self-overcoming is necessary in order to create meaning and purpose in our lives, and to transcend the constraints of conventional morality and society.

Rudolf Steiner, the founder of anthroposophy, a spiritual philosophy that emphasizes the development of individual consciousness and the spiritual nature of humanity, argued that individuals must develop their own inner capacities in order to overcome their limitations and achieve their full potential. Steiner believed that the process of self-development requires us to cultivate our own inner wisdom and knowledge, and to connect with our own spiritual nature. By doing so, we can overcome our own limitations and achieve a greater sense of self-realization.

Jacques Lacan, the French psychoanalyst, argued that individuals are constantly striving to overcome their own limitations and limitations imposed by society. According to Lacan, this process of self-overcoming requires us to confront and overcome our own unconscious desires and conflicts, and to develop a more coherent and integrated sense of self. By doing so, we can overcome our own limitations and achieve a greater sense of self-realization and fulfillment.

Lou Salome, the German-Russian philosopher and psychoanalyst, argued that individuals must overcome their own limitations and self-imposed boundaries in order to achieve their full potential. Salome believed that this process requires us to confront and overcome our own fears and doubts, and to embrace our own power and strength. By doing so, we can overcome our own limitations and achieve a greater sense of self-realization and fulfillment.

In conclusion, self-overcoming and the ceasing of the need to be competitive require us to confront and overcome our own limitations, fears, and doubts, and to embrace our own power and strength. By incorporating the insights and perspectives of Nietzsche, Steiner, Lacan, and Salome into our thinking and acting, we can develop a useful framework for living a more fulfilling and meaningful life.


Old English Voice:
Ah, woe is me, how dreary is this life
A never-ending cycle of toil and strife
The days drag on, and the nights are long
As I sit and ponder, my heart grows cold

Modern Voice:
God, I hate this life, it's just so bleak
Every day the same, I can't take the heat
I'm stuck in this rut, can't find my way out
Feels like I'm drowning, I want to scream and shout

Old English Voice:
Verily, I know not what to do
The burden of existence weighs heavy on my brow
The world is cruel, and fate is unkind
Leaving me to wander, lost and confined

Modern Voice:
I'm sick of this crap, I can't take it anymore
This life is a joke, I can't take it on the floor
I'm done with the struggle, I just want to be free
From this hell on earth, I just want to be me

Old English Voice:
In my despair, I turn to thoughts most dire
Of ending it all, and setting my soul on fire
For if life is but pain, and love a fleeting dream
Then death may be sweet, and a final release

Modern Voice:
Yeah, I've thought about it too, ending it all
But then I remember the ones I love, and the thought makes me fall
To my knees, because I can't leave them behind
But I'm tired of fighting, my energy is confined

Old English Voice:
Thus, we are trapped, in this endless cycle of woe
Hating our lives, but not daring to let them go
For even in death, there may be no release
From the chains of existence, and the endless cease

Modern Voice:
Yeah, it's a tough call, but I guess we carry on
Hoping for something more, before our time is gone
But sometimes, it's hard to find the light
In this dark and gloomy world, it's a never-ending fight.
