  `Reason: individuating the details, nuances and specifics of any domain or problem from generalities, trust dynamics, and learned heuristics, via a largely subjective process of inferential and categorial deliberation between the given or what is known and what is thought possible or acceptable considering what is.. or at least, feels.. given. "The Given", as ground, is the world's own trans-subjective self-reflection, ever subject to correction. Self-correction is the heart of reason, for reason is constrained by the medium of expression, which is in the case of human cognition, symbolic, refferential, and most likely constrained by the particularities of a history, grammar, and vocabulary. As a tool, reason needs no definition, it is simply the ordinary physical pragmatism of mind, embodied in any metaphor you like, be it that water flows down the easiest path every time, or, the reality of cellular intelligence as a kind of biological communism, and (in multicellular organisms) caste system, oriented toward collective problem solving for the end of pleasure, survival, and reproduction. However it is, reason moves with the efficacy of minded-beings' capacity to realitate (yes, it's a verb), in harmonic balance with the world's song or with 'absolute knowing' qua authenticity, implicating a (non-isomorphic) relationship with its own substance which shares an unmediated or unmembraned inter-flowing nature with all other domains of substance, or.. speculated upon temporally, substances might perhaps be thought of as higher dimentional sounds, or concretions of spatially distributed forces or monads of pure process individuated by their mutual interferences as the only things that exist (stand out from the background of non-individuation [not objects, but shapes in the sand, like energetic striations of a continuous smooth space far kept from total equilibrium]), which is to say differences in-themselves, qua hertz in a medium where non-movement does not exist, are all that divide structure from the eternal nothingness of an infinite plain monadic substrate, from which nothing can be taken and nothing put back, except for the intensities or resonant pangs in the web of its own totality, with time as the only currency determinant of being.`,
